-- This is the final project for Introduction to Functional

-- library together. This file is made up of explanations (like this)
-- and some prepared code. Some definitions you'll have to fill in
-- yourself, just like in the previous exercise sets.

-- We'll use the JuicyPixels library to generate images. The library
-- exposes the Codec.Picture module that has everything we need.

-- Let's start by defining Colors and Pictures.

-- We use Ints for convenience even though the valid range is only
-- 0-255.

-- Here are some colors

black :: Color

-- A coordinate is two Ints, x and y. In this project, the (0,0)
-- coordinate is in the top left corner of the image. The x coordinate
-- increases to the right, and the y coordinate increases down.

data Coord = Coord Int Int

-- A Picture is a wrapper for a function of type Coord -> Color.
-- The function takes in x and y coordinates and returns a color.

data Picture = Picture (Coord -> Color)

-- Here's a simple picture:

                      | otherwise = black         -- rest of the picture is black


-- In order to find out what our example picture looks like, here's a
-- function that renders a Picture into a png file.
--
-- In addition to the Picture it takes a width and a height.
--
-- The return type is IO (). Check Lecture 8 for a short introduction
-- to IO

-- To see examplePicture1, run this in GHCi:
--
--   render examplePicture1 400 300 "example1.png"
--
-- This should produce an example1.png file.
--
-- Remember: You can get open GHCi with `stack ghci Set8.hs`

-- For testing purposes, let's also define some functions for drawing
-- pictures as lists. It's customary to show colours as hexadecimal
-- strings. This is what colorToHex does.

-- Ex 2: blending colors and images.
--
-- Implement the function blendColor that averages two Colors,

--
-- Implement the function combine that takes a function and two images
-- and makes a new image by applying the function to the corresponding

--
--   combine blendColor p1 p2
--
-- should average two images, pixel by pixel.
--
-- PS. Use rounding down integer division (i.e. the div function) for
-- the average.
--
-- Examples:
--   blendColor (Color 10 100 0) (Color 0 200 40)
--     ==> Color 5 150 20
--   renderList (combine (\c1 c2 -> c1) (solid red) justADot) (9,11) (9,11)
